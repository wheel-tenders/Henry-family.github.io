            <p>Hi my name is Will and I live in Fairfax, Virginia. 
                I was born in Dumfries, Virginia on February 24th 2011, 
                and lived in Prince William Virginia growing up. I moved to Fairfax,  
                Virginia in 2020 and have lived here ever since.
                My hobbies are what most people my age do, play games, hangout, and overall have fun. 
                My interests are what stick out to most people I want to become a pilot when I'm older. 
                One trait I have is I do a lot of different hobbies such as 3d printing, guitar, coding, and many more little hobbies.
            </p>
            <p>
                My parents were born here and my mom has lived here her whole life, rather than my dad who has moved up to Connecticut! My mom is an English teacher teaching for West Springfield High School. And my dad is a software developer. I also have a sister who is a freshman at Robinson. My family is from America and on my moms side my great great grandparents have a town named after them called ‘Sunman’. On my dads side also my great great grandad was a mathematician named Author Bryon Coble.

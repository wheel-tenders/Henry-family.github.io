            <p>Life as a teenager in the 90’s is much different then today in many ways that we will discuss in this essay. First we have to talk about their life. Technology was much different because they didn’t have the internet or phones, but they did have game systems and tv’s and many other gadgets to keep them entertained. The social life was also very different because nowadays kids usually socialize on their phones or on a game (which is what I do). Their social life mostly consisted of hanging outside instead of technology like nowadays, they mostly did fun stuff that constituted being physically with each other.
                This shows that there are many different aspects of being a teenager now compared to being a teenager in the 90s. Some areas might very like fashion, food, and the government but technologies have been the biggest change out of everything. Stuff like cell phones. Computers. And even tv’s have changed tremendously. Back then you had to go to a phone on the wall and dial up a number when now you have to reach into your pocket and press a button that doesn't physically exist. Also I want to talk about politics because it has felt like its gotten much more heated then in the 90s

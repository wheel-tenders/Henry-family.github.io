            <p>I am from virginia
                My family is not
                They're from England
                So the historyâ€™s a knot <br><br>
                
                They moved for farm
                The farm was a charm
                The land was fantastic
                I'm not being sarcastic <br><br>
                
                They sold the farm
                For a leg and arm 
                The farm was getting old 
                So it was time to get sold <br><br>
